## Terms and Conditions

You should be aware that there are certain things that Muhammad Mahdi Qazwini will not take responsibility for. Firstly, realize that the only correct way of determining prayer times is through visual inspection. Therefore, calculated prayer times are always estimates, not exact. Secondly, hadiths for all the duas, a'mal, and ziyarat, were not collected by me. I simply took the contents of the book Dua & Ziyarah. There could be a few mistakes in grammar, and, although unlikely, some hadiths may not be completely accurate.
